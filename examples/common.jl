    steppers(mpo; maxdim, trunc_thresh, maxiter)

The three integrators, as closures over one MPO. Any difference between them is the integrator.

`cbe_bug` runs with the exact SVD rather than the randomised sketch. That simplification IS free:
the sketch is measured bit-identical to the exact SVD on both example models
(`benchmarks/rsvd_param_scan.jl` phase 0, relative difference 0.000e+00).

`cbe_bug` otherwise runs at its package defaults, INCLUDING the Krylov depth of the half-sweep
basis (`krylov_basis = 30`, `krylov_tol = 1e-6`). That is deliberate: depth is the knob that
actually moves this scheme's error, so pinning it here would make these scripts report something
no user runs.

⛔ DO NOT VALIDATE A BASIS-CONSTRUCTION CHANGE ON XX. It is a control, never the evidence. The XX
domain wall stays low-rank enough that basis choices do not bind, and it has now failed to show
FOUR separate real effects while TFIM or OAT showed each of them plainly:

    effect                              XX               TFIM / OAT
    the old projection defect           invisible        2.5e-01  (TFIM)
    the old midpoint basis (retired)    bit-identical    cost an ORDER (TFIM)
    width restoration (retired)         free             five orders (TFIM)
    KRYLOV DEPTH  m=0 -> m=3            bit-identical    eight orders (OAT)

⛔ AND DO NOT RANK ARMS BY ENERGY DRIFT OR BY THE BOND PROFILE. On OAT at L=10, D=6 (the exact
ceiling), a `krylov_basis = 0` run conserves energy to 1.5e-14, lands EXACTLY on the analytic
Schmidt profile `min(k, L-k) + 1` = [2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2], exits 0 and writes its CSV -- while
sitting eight orders from the answer. Both diagnostics say it is perfect. Only a comparison
against an exact reference finds it.

Evolve `psi0` under `mpo` with each of the three integrators, streaming one CSV row per sample.

leaves usable data and a long run can be plotted while it is still going.
